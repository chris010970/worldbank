    "WBGAPI provides modern, pythonic access to the World Bank's data API. WBGAPI differs from other packages for World Bank data in a few respects and in general tries to take full advantage of the World Bank's powerful API while mitigating the impact of some its ideosyncracies. The most significant difference from other packages is that WBGAPI queries databases individually instead of collectively. By default, WBGAPI queries the World Development Indicators database (db=2) but the default can be changed for each request or globally. This prevents confusion when indicators such as population (SP.POP.TOTL) appear in several different databases or when different databases have different dimensions, economies or time periods."
